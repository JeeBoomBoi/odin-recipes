    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Indian food is not just curried sauces. It's not too exotic either. Unless 'exotic' is code for 'yummy and full
        of flavor.' This dish features a healthy mixture of chickpeas, tomatoes, onion, and spices. Both carnivores and
        vegetarians will enjoy this meal.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can chickpeas</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tomato, chopped</li>
        <li>1 ginger</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>3 tbsps olive oil</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 tsp chili powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp coriander powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp garam masala</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp tumeric powder</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>water (as needed)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Grind onion, tomato, ginger, garlic, and chile pepper together in a food processor into a paste.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry bay leaves in hot oil until fragrant, about 30
            seconds. Pour the paste into the skillet and cook until the oil begins to separate from the mixture and is
            golden brown in color, 2 to 3 minutes. Season the mixture with chili powder, coriander, powder, gram masala,
            turmeric, and salt; cook and stir until very hot, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir enough water into the mixture to get a thick gravy; bring to a boil and stir chickpeas into the gravy.
            Reduce heat to medium and cook until the chickpeas are heated through, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
